# ChatGPT — Gecko app for iOS 16

Experimental **ChatGPT app** using the complete mobile website at https://chatgpt.com, powered by **Reynard Browser's Gecko engine** instead of iOS WebKit. The UI is the actual ChatGPT website, not a recreation of its conversations or API. Reynard's address bar and browser tab controls are hidden.

- App display name: **ChatGPT**
- Bundle ID: `com.551uk.chatgptgecko`
- Reynard: **0.19.0**; Firefox Gecko: **158.0.1**
- Target: **iOS 16, TrollStore** (including Dopamine rootless devices)
- ChatGPT account login; website features, conversation history, attachments and voice are provided by the ChatGPT site itself, subject to browser/device support
- Separate from the official ChatGPT app and from the original Reynard installation

## Installation

Download the `ChatGPT-Gecko-iOS16.ipa` artifact from Actions or the test release, install through **TrollStore**, and keep the helper app extension. This is not an iOS rootless tweak or an old-version ChatGPT IPA.

## Building

GitHub Actions downloads the official **Reynard-TrollStore.tipa** from the fixed `0.19.0` release, compiles our Objective-C app shell on macOS, adds it as an executable dependency, rebrands icons/bundle identifiers, signs the app and extension and generates the IPA. You don't need the full Firefox/Gecko source to rebuild. See `scripts/package.sh`.

## What remains experimental

This package and shell integration are **not yet device-tested**. Upstream browser UI changes can affect the hide/layout hook. Gecko JIT, login and file pickers must be tested on a real iOS 16 device. If the hook fails, the app should remain an ordinary usable Reynard browser.

The app uses the user's supplied blue-to-purple ChatGPT home-screen icon, embedded directly in the reproducible icon generator. Reynard's URL handlers and optional Open In extension are removed, and its Gecko helper uses a distinct app identifier.

## Acknowledgements and licensing

This app builds on [Reynard Browser](https://github.com/minh-ton/reynard-browser) by Minh Ton and Mozilla Gecko. Their engine, applications, open-source licenses and attribution remain upstream. No Reynard binary is stored in this repository; release assets are downloaded only at build time. This is an unofficial, independent ChatGPT website client, not an OpenAI-produced or endorsed application.
